<p>I should begin this section with saying that there is nothing <i>inherently</i> wrong with Google. Nor is there anything inherently wrong with using a Windows operating system. Or Apple products, for that matter. Billions of people around the world use these systems everyday. Their advancement has provided untold ability to learn and improve life for nearly everyone on the planet. However the problem with Google lies in its ubiquity, as well as its ability to store vast amounts of data on us, with little to no external oversight. Its very success is the reason we should be so determined to resist it.</p>

<p>When there is no external oversight over an organization, you must trust that organization to always act in your best interests. Once upon a time, Google's slogan was "do no evil." Those days are, of course, now long gone: Google's quest for power and consolidation of the internet services market have reached a fever pitch to rival the closing of it's competitors' (Microsoft and Apple's) ecosystems.</p>

<p>While Google has done a notable job in providing transparency when it comes to "official" government takedown requests, one can see that the amount of them are growing each and every year. Not all of them are granted (thankfully) but this is only due to Google's resistance. When the financial incentive to resistance no longer swings their way, however, you will find that even the most well-viewed company will change their tune remarkably quick.</p>

<p>The question here is this: What fundamental responsibility do we have to our own information? What are our personal details, our meetings and writing, our entire lives that are now exceedingly being stored and lived on the internet, really worth to us? This is something that only each individual can decide for themselves. But the question is only becoming more pertinent. As an incredible amount of our lives these days is lived on the Internet, it merits a very serious and sober look at just what we own and who we give it to for "safekeeping."</p>

<p>And the age-old slogan "If you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide," has lost any merit it may have ever had. In these days of wireless surveillance, we know that any individual can be caught up in the fray. From the US and UK's monitoring of Occupy activists to the Obama administration's breathless expansion of state surveillance powers, governments around the world have raced to prove that, even if you stand up for a cause you believe in, peacefully and well within your "rights," you WILL be targeted. Even if you are a simple bystander, your personal data can be rifled through with impunity.</p>

<p>Even if you've "done nothing wrong," AND you don't care about government spooks looking through your daily calendar, it's even more absurd that companies like Facebook and Google are gathering huge volumes of advertising data on us without most people knowing. An Austrian law student currently pursuing Facebook in court found that the company had more than 1,000 pages of data on him. Not only his favourite movies and drunk self-portraits: intimate details of his browsing history, and advertising profiles created based on the things he's viewed, liked and subscribed to. Facebook created his very own consumer "imprint," and this data gets sold to advertising groups around the world. This brings up an even more confounding fundamental question: why do we let companies like Facebook monetize our universe like this with impunity? Is it right that companies get to sell our intimate details without our knowledge for their astronomical profit?</p>

<p>When it comes to security and data rights online, things are only moving in one direction. And that is towards more control for large corporations and governments, and less control for individual users. In the best of cases, this means our private and intimate data being used to enrich morally unscrupulous corporations. In the worst, it means surveillance, monitoring and snooping for those who express an opinion the government might not endorse. These serious concerns for safety and privacy can only be countered with a cohesive strategy for personal data liberation and independence.</p>
